# BuildingLinkDriver Solution Overview
The BuildingLinkDriver solution is a comprehensive system designed to facilitate effective management and testing of drivers through a multi-project architecture. Comprising three key components—BuildingLinkDriver, DriversCLI, and DriverUnitTest—this solution offers a robust framework for development and testing, leveraging SQLite for efficient data handling. Below is a detailed overview of the solution, including setup instructions, configuration guidelines, and project structure.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Git for repository cloning
Preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with support for .NET development
### Setup Instructions
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
Open the solution in your IDE of choice.
Ensure the Swagger UI is configured to launch automatically with the startup project for immediate API exploration.
## Configuration
### DriversCLI Project
Modify the appsettings.json file within the DriversCLI project to adjust the base URL for the CLI interface. Update the ApiBaseUrl with your target URL to ensure the CLI communicates correctly with the API.

## Usage
Comprehensive usage instructions for the DriversCLI project are provided through the console upon project execution. These instructions detail available commands and their respective functionalities, enabling straightforward interaction with the API endpoints.

## Documentation
Each method within the project is accompanied by extensive documentation in the source code comments. This documentation offers insights into the purpose and usage of each method, facilitating easier understanding and maintenance of the codebase.

## Project Structure
### BuildingLinkDriver
The core project of the system, organized into controllers, services, and data layers for a structured and scalable architecture.

#### Controllers
DriversController: Manages CRUD operations for drivers.
OperationsController: Handles creation of fake/random drivers and alphabetizes driver names.
#### Services
DriverService: Bridges controllers and the database, managing CRUD operations and business logic for drivers.
OperationService: Implements functionalities for generating fake drivers and alphabetizing driver names.
#### Data
DriverRepository: Directly interacts with the database for CRUD operations, implementing IDriversRepository.
DatabaseUtils: Manages database tasks, including drivers table creation and seed data insertion.
### DriversCLI
Provides a Command Line Interface for interacting with the BuildingLinkDriver project's API endpoints. It serves as a practical tool for endpoint testing and interaction.

### DriverUnitTest
Contains unit tests for the BuildingLinkDriver project, ensuring code reliability and correctness by testing components and functionalities individually.

This professional rewrite aims to present the BuildingLinkDriver solution in a clear, structured, and detailed manner, facilitating understanding and engagement for developers and stakeholders alike.
